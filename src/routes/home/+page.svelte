				Welcome to the Kairos-Project, an initiative to revive old games and game mods so they can
				be enjoyed by a new generation of players or even by those who played them before.
			</p>

			<p>
				I myself used to play the games we provide back in the days. I think it's a shame that these
				games are no longer available on official servers. Therefore, I decided to create this
				project to bring them back to life.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our values is to share what used to making gaming so fun including the community aspect, not
				having shitty battle passes and so on.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are also very keen to improve the gaming experience by taking any available feedback from
				the community on platforms like
				<a
					href="https://discord.gg/C4tmWagc"
					class="inline-flex items-center gap-1 font-semibold text-indigo-600 underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition-all duration-200 hover:text-indigo-800 hover:decoration-indigo-800"
				>
					Discord
				</a>
				or even on the servers :)
